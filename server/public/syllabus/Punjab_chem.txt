INTRODUCTION
Aldehydes and ketones hold significant importance, with widespread usage in several industries. They are the simplest carbonyl compounds; both contain a carbonyl group, which is a functional group consisting of a carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom.

Aldehydes contain a carbonyl group at the terminal carbon of their carbon chain, whereas ketone have a carbonyl group located on the carbon within their carbon chain. Both types of compounds have unique properties and reactivity due to the presence of the carbonyl group, which makes them useful in a variety of applications.

The typical representatives of this class of compounds are formaldehyde, acetone, benzaldehyde and acetophenone. Formaldehyde is exceptional since it carries two hydrogen atoms instead of alkyl substituents.

Organic chemistry emphasizes the study of aldehyde and ketones due to their significant applications in various industrial sectors.

For example, formaldehyde is used to produce resins, synthetic plastic and urea formaldehyde. Acetone is used in the preparation of iodoform, chloroform and nail polish remover. Benzaldehyde is used in the manufacturing of dyes etc.

8.1 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES

Physical State: Methanal and ethanal are gases; the other lower aldehydes and ketones are colourless liquids at room temperature. The higher aldehydes and ketones (more than C₁₀) are solids at room temperature.

Odour: Lower aldehydes have a pungent smell whereas ketones and higher aldehydes have a pleasant smell.

Boiling Point: Carbonyl compounds have higher boiling points than alkanes of similar molecular weights due to the polar nature of the carbonyl group, enabling intermolecular forces. However, they have lower boiling points compared to alcohols and carboxylic acids due to the absence of intermolecular hydrogen bonding.

Solubility: Carbonyl compounds are generally polar, and they are soluble in polar solvents such as water and ethanol. However, their solubility decreases as the size of the hydrophobic group (hydrocarbon chain) attached to the carbonyl carbon increases.

8.2 STRUCTURE OF ALDEHYDES AND KETONES

In aldehyde and ketone, the carbonyl group comprises a carbon atom that is double bonded to an oxygen atom. The carbon atom in the carbonyl group is sp² hybridized, with one of its sp² hybrid orbitals participating in sigma bond formation with the oxygen atom, while the other two sp² hybrid orbitals form sigma bonds with other atoms. The unhybrid p orbital of the carbon atom in the carbonyl group forms a pi bond with the oxygen atom. (Fig. 8.1)

The sp² hybridization of the carbon atom in the carbonyl group allows it to acquire a trigonal planar geometry, with bond angles of approximately 120°.

8.3 PREPARATION OF ALDEHYDES AND KETONES
8.3.1 Ozonolysis of Alkenes
Alkenes can be ozonolyzed to yield aldehydes and ketones. This reaction involves the breaking of C=C of alkene by the use of ozone and reducing agent such as zinc.

(Shown: Reactions of ethene and 2,3-dimethyl butene with ozone forming ozonides, which yield formaldehyde and acetone respectively in presence of Zn/H₂O at 100°C)
(It is a reaction diagram showing ozonolysis of ethene and 2,3-dimethyl butene to form formaldehyde and acetone respectively)

8.3.2 Hydration of Alkyne
Alkynes when heated with water in the presence of H₂SO₄ and HgSO₄, an acid catalysed addition reaction occur on C ≡ C to form an unstable enol which then on tautomerization, gives aldehyde or ketone.

(i) The hydration of ethyne gives acetaldehyde:

(Shown: Reaction of ethyne + H₂O → Enol → Rearrangement → Acetaldehyde)
(It is a diagram showing hydration of ethyne to form acetaldehyde via enol intermediate)

(ii) The hydration of propyne gives propanone:

(Shown: Reaction of propyne + H₂O → Enol → Rearrangement → Acetone)
(It is a diagram showing hydration of propyne to form acetone via enol intermediate)

8.3.3 Oxidation of Alcohol
In the oxidation of alcohols, the –OH functional groups are converted to carbonyl groups (C=O). Primary alcohols are oxidized to aldehydes, and secondary alcohols are oxidized to ketones, which can be achieved using pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) as an oxidizing agent. However, tertiary alcohols do not undergo oxidation. This controlled process is valuable in obtaining specific carbonyl compounds in organic synthesis.

🧠 DO YOU KNOW?
Formalin is an aqueous solution of formaldehyde, typically containing 37–40% formaldehyde by weight. It is used as a disinfectant and preservative for biological specimens. However, it is a known carcinogen and can cause skin and respiratory irritation and should be handled with caution and appropriate protective measures.

8.3.4 Friedel–Craft Acylation of Aromatic Compounds
Aromatic ketones can be synthesized through the Friedel Craft acylation method. In this reaction, an acyl chloride reacts with benzene or its derivatives in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, typically aluminum chloride (AlCl₃).

(Shown: Reaction of benzene with acyl chloride and AlCl₃ to form acetophenone + HCl)
(It is a diagram showing Friedel–Craft acylation of benzene to form acetophenone)

8.4 REACTIVITY OF CARBONYL COMPOUNDS
The carbon–oxygen bond (C=O) in the carbonyl group is highly polar due to the electronegativity difference between carbon and oxygen. It creates partially negative charge on oxygen and partially positive charge on hydrogen, making the carbon and oxygen atoms in aldehydes and ketones act as electrophiles and nucleophiles. Aldehydes are more reactive than ketones due to less steric hindrance (having one alkyl group) and a greater electron-withdrawing effect of the aldehyde’s hydrogen, which enhances the electrophilicity of its carbonyl carbon, making it more attractive to nucleophiles.

8.5 REACTIONS OF ALDEHYDE AND KETONES
Aldehyde and Ketone undergo following types of reactions:
(i) Nucleophilic addition reactions
(ii) Reduction reaction
(iii) Oxidation reaction

📄 Page 194
8.5.1 Nucleophilic addition reaction
In these reactions, nucleophiles attack the carbonyl carbon of aldehydes and ketones, leading to a change in the hybridization of the carbon atom from sp² to sp³. The pi electron pair of C=O shifts towards the oxygen atom, forming an alkoxide intermediate, which is subsequently protonated to yield the addition product.

(Diagram showing nucleophile attacking carbonyl group forming intermediate and final product)
(It is a diagram of nucleophilic addition showing mechanism from reactant to alkoxide intermediate to product)

Nucleophilic addition reactions can be either acid-catalyzed or base-catalyzed, depending on the nature of reactants and the reaction conditions.

(i) Acid catalysed Nucleophilic addition reactions
An acid catalyst is employed in a case where a carbonyl compound reacts with weak nucleophile for addition. The acidic proton attacks the carbonyl atom, resulting in the formation of a protonated carbonyl group. This protonation enhances the electrophilic behavior of the carbonyl carbon making it more responsive to a nucleophile. Thus, a weak nucleophile can easily attack on carbonyl carbon and give the addition product. The general mechanism of acid catalysed nucleophilic addition on aldehyde and ketone is written as:

(Diagram showing general mechanism of acid catalysed nucleophilic addition)
(It is a reaction diagram showing stepwise acid catalysed addition on carbonyl compound)

Addition of hydrazine (NH₂–NH₂) and hydroxyl amine (NH₂OH) on aldehyde and ketone is catalyzed by an acid.

(Shown: Reactions of propanone with NH₂OH and NH₂NH₂ forming oxime and hydrazone respectively)
(It is a diagram showing formation of propanone oxime and propanone hydrazone)


📄 Page 195
(ii) Base catalysed Nucleophilic addition reaction
Addition of strong nucleophilic reagents on aldehyde and ketone is catalysed by base. The base first reacts with the reagent to generate a nucleophile. The nucleophile then attacks on carbonyl carbon. The pi electron of C=O is then shifted towards oxygen atom to form tetrahedral alkoxide ion as intermediate. This intermediate captures a proton or the electrophile to give the product.
General mechanism of base catalysed Nucleophilic addition reaction is given as:

Addition of HCN and Grignard reagent is catalysed by base.

8.5.2 Reduction of Aldehyde and Ketone
The reduction of aldehydes and ketones involves the addition of hydrogen to the carbonyl group resulting in the formation of an alkane or alcohol depending upon the suitable reducing agent used in the reaction.

8.5.2.1 Reduction to Hydrocarbon
The reduction of aldehyde and ketone into saturated hydrocarbons is carried out in a mixture of zinc amalgam and concentrated HCl is used. This is known as Clemmensen reduction.

CH₃CHO + 4[H] → CH₃CH₃ + H₂O

CH₃COCH₃ + 4[H] → CH₃CH₂CH₃ + H₂O

(It is a diagram showing Clemmensen reduction of acetaldehyde and acetone into ethane and propane)

Aldehyde and ketone can also be converted into alkane by using hydrazine (NH₂–NH₂) and potassium hydroxide. This is known as Wolff–Kishner reaction.

8.5.2.2 Reduction to Alcohol
Aldehyde and ketone when treated with strong reducing agents such as NaBH₄ or LiAlH₄, they reduce into primary and secondary alcohols respectively.

CH₃CHO + H₂ → CH₃CH₂OH (Primary alcohol)

CH₃COCH₃ + H₂ → CH₃CH(OH)CH₃ (Secondary alcohol)

(It is a reaction diagram showing LiAlH₄ reduction of acetaldehyde and acetone to alcohols)

8.5.3 Oxidation Reaction
Aldehydes and ketones undergo oxidation with an oxidizing agent to give carboxylic acid. However, the reactivity of aldehyde towards oxidation reaction is quite easy due to the availability of active hydrogen atom at the carbonyl position, thus:
i. A variety of mild oxidizing agents such as chromic acid (H₂CrO₄), Tollen’s reagent, Fehling reagent and Benedict reagent can be used to convert aldehyde into corresponding carboxylic acid. Aldehydes can also be oxidized by strong oxidizing agents.

CH₃CHO + [O] → CH₃COOH (Acetic acid)

(It is a diagram showing oxidation of aldehyde using H₂CrO₄ to acetic acid)

ii. Oxidation of ketone is relatively slow and it involves the breaking of carbon–carbon sigma bond and it happens only in the presence of strong oxidizing agent.

Laboratory test to distinguish between aldehydes and ketones
(i) Silver mirror test
The reagent used for this test is ammoniacal silver nitrate (Tollen’s reagent). Since this reagent has short shelf life, it should be freshly prepared in laboratory by mixing silver nitrate and ammonium hydroxide.

Reaction:
RCHO + 2[Ag(NH₃)₂]⁺ + 3OH⁻ → RCOO⁻ + 2Ag↓ + 2NH₃ + 2H₂O

(It is a diagram showing silver mirror test for aldehyde)

While performing the test, tollen’s reagent is mixed with the given carbonyl compound and heated to boiling. If aldehyde is present, a silver mirror will form on the inside of the test tube.

(ii) Fehling test
There are two Fehling solutions available in laboratory. Fehling A is an aqueous copper (II) sulphate solution while Fehling B is an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) with sodium potassium tartrate.

To carry out the Fehling’s test, mix equal volumes of Fehling A and B in a test tube. Heat the mixture to boiling and then add a small amount of aldehyde. If aldehyde is present, the blue colour of the copper solution (Cu²⁺) changes to red precipitate (ppt) of copper (I) oxide.

Reaction:
RCHO + 2Cu²⁺ + 5OH⁻ → RCOO⁻ + Cu₂O↓ + 3H₂O

8.5.4 Difference between Aldehyde and Ketone
Basic Structure: Both aldehydes and ketones are carbonyl compounds but in aldehydes, the carbonyl carbon is attached with at least one alkyl or aryl group while in ketones, carbonyl carbon is attached with two alkyl or aryl groups.

Physical Properties: The boiling point of ketones is relatively higher than aldehydes since carbonyl group of ketones is more polarised than aldehydes.

Reactivity: The reactivity of aldehydes towards nucleophilic addition is greater than ketones because of less steric hindrance and less electronic effect.

Oxidation into Carboxylic acid: Ketones oxidizes to carboxylic acid with strong oxidizing agent such as potassium dichromate (K₂Cr₂O₇) and potassium permanganate (KMnO₄) while aldehydes can easily be oxidized to carboxylic acid with mild oxidizing agent such as chromic acid (H₂CrO₄), Tollen’s reagent and Fehling solution and Benedict solution.

Reduction into alcohol: Reduction of aldehydes in the presence of strong reducing agents such as lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) and sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) gives primary alcohol while the reduction of ketones gives secondary alcohol.
